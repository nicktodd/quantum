    "# Portfolio Optimization with Quantum Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Portfolio optimization is one of the most promising near-term applications of quantum computing in finance. The problem of selecting the best combination of assets to maximize returns while minimizing risk is a **combinatorial optimization problem** that becomes exponentially harder as the number of assets increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a portfolio manager with access to hundreds or thousands of potential assets (stocks, bonds, commodities, etc.). You need to:\n",
    "- Select a subset of K assets to include in your portfolio\n",
    "- Maximize expected returns\n",
    "- Minimize risk (typically measured by variance or volatility)\n",
    "- Respect various constraints (budget, sector limits, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical approaches struggle with this because:\n",
    "- The number of possible portfolios grows exponentially: choosing 10 assets from 100 gives ~17 billion combinations\n",
    "- Evaluating each portfolio requires computing correlations between all selected assets\n",
    "- Real-world constraints add further complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantum Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computers can explore many candidate portfolios \"in parallel\" through superposition. Algorithms like **QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm)** can:\n",
    "- Encode the portfolio selection problem as an energy minimization problem\n",
    "- Use quantum interference to amplify good solutions\n",
    "- Converge toward low-energy (high-quality) portfolios faster than exhaustive classical search\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Teaching Point\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum computing doesn't guarantee the absolute best portfolio** — it finds very good candidates faster as problem complexity grows. For small problems, classical algorithms may be sufficient or even faster. The quantum advantage appears when:\n",
    "- The problem size becomes classically intractable\n",
    "- Finding a \"good enough\" solution quickly is more valuable than guaranteeing optimality\n",
    "- The cost of quantum computation is justified by the potential returns\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll demonstrate portfolio optimization using Qiskit's built-in optimization tools."

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Combinatorial Optimization**: Portfolio selection is fundamentally about choosing the best combination of assets from a large set of possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **QUBO Formulation**: We encoded the portfolio problem as a binary optimization problem suitable for quantum algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **QAOA in Action**: The quantum algorithm explored the solution space and found high-quality portfolios without exhaustive search.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Risk-Return Trade-off**: By varying the risk factor λ, we can generate different portfolios along the efficient frontier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Points for Finance Professionals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum Advantage Appears When:**\n",
    "- The number of assets is large (100s to 1000s)\n",
    "- Additional constraints exist (sector limits, ESG criteria, transaction costs)\n",
    "- Finding \"good enough\" solutions quickly is more valuable than guaranteed optimality\n",
    "- The problem has complex non-linear interactions (correlations, tail risks)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- QAOA doesn't guarantee finding the global optimum\n",
    "- Current quantum hardware has noise and limited qubit counts\n",
    "- Classical solvers (like branch-and-bound or convex optimization) may be faster for small problems\n",
    "- The quality of the solution depends on the QAOA depth (p) and classical optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Considerations:**\n",
    "- In production, you'd run QAOA multiple times and take the best result\n",
    "- Hybrid classical-quantum approaches often work best\n",
    "- The problem encoding (choice of penalty parameters) significantly affects results\n",
    "- Real-world portfolio optimization includes transaction costs, tax implications, and regulatory constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensions to Explore\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **More Assets**: Scale to 20-50 stocks to see where quantum advantage begins\n",
    "2. **Additional Constraints**: Add sector limits, minimum/maximum positions per asset\n",
    "3. **Alternative Risk Models**: Use CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) instead of variance\n",
    "4. **Real Market Data**: Use actual historical prices and correlations\n",
    "5. **Rebalancing**: Solve the problem of transitioning from current portfolio to optimal one\n",
    "6. **Factor Models**: Incorporate Fama-French factors or other risk models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Quantum Optimization Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "- **VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver)**: Similar to QAOA but for finding ground states\n",
    "- **Quantum Annealing**: Hardware-based approach (D-Wave systems)\n",
    "- **QAOA+**: Enhanced versions with problem-specific mixers\n",
    "- **Grover Adaptive Search**: For unstructured search problems\n",

    "## Exercise: Try It Yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've seen portfolio optimization with QAOA, try modifying the parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easy:**\n",
    "1. Change the `budget` to select 4 or 5 assets instead of 3\n",
    "2. Modify the `risk_factor` to see how it affects the selected portfolio\n",
    "3. Increase `reps` (QAOA depth) to see if it finds better solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Medium:**\n",
    "4. Add 2-3 more stocks to the universe and re-run the optimization\n",
    "5. Try setting different correlations in the correlation matrix\n",
    "6. Plot the historical performance of the selected portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced:**\n",
    "7. Add a constraint that no more than 2 assets from the same sector can be selected\n",
    "8. Implement a simple transaction cost model (penalty for deviating from current portfolio)\n",
    "9. Compare QAOA results with a classical solver (e.g., brute force for small n, or CPLEX)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research:**\n",
    "10. Read about the VQE algorithm and compare it to QAOA\n",
    "11. Investigate quantum annealing approaches (D-Wave) for portfolio optimization\n",
