    "# Applied Quantum Computing Lab: Grover's Algorithm (SOLUTIONS)\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will guide you through implementing and understanding Grover's algorithm, one of the most important quantum algorithms that provides a quadratic speedup for search problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Basic understanding of quantum gates (Hadamard, X, Z, CNOT)\n",
    "- Familiarity with Python and Qiskit\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "By completing this lab, you will:\n",
    "1. Understand the fundamental concepts of Grover's search algorithm\n",
    "2. Implement different components of the algorithm (oracle and diffusion operator)\n",
    "3. Analyze how the algorithm's performance scales with problem size\n",
    "4. Visualize probability amplification through iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Grover's algorithm, developed by Lov Grover in 1996, is a quantum algorithm designed to search through an unstructured database or solve an unstructured search problem. It provides a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem Statement**: Imagine you have a list of N unsorted items and want to find a specific one that satisfies a particular condition.\n",
    "   - Classical approach: Check items one by one (O(N) operations in the worst case)\n",
    "   - Grover's approach: Find the answer in approximately O(√N) operations\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Quantum Advantage**: Grover's algorithm achieves this speedup by using quantum superposition and a technique called amplitude amplification to increase the probability of measuring the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Algorithm Steps**:\n",
    "   - Initialize a quantum system in a superposition of all possible states\n",
    "   - Apply an oracle function that marks the solution(s)\n",
    "   - Apply the Grover diffusion operator that amplifies the amplitude of the marked state(s)\n",
    "   - Repeat the oracle and diffusion operations approximately √N times\n",
    "   - Measure the system to obtain the solution with high probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement Grover's algorithm step by step."

    "**Answers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The CZ (controlled-Z) gate applies a phase flip (multiplication by -1) to the target qubit only when the control qubit is in state |1⟩. When both qubits are in state |1⟩ (giving the state |11⟩), the phase gets flipped. The CZ gate doesn't change the probability of measuring any state, but it does change the phase of the |11⟩ state, marking it for amplification by the diffusion operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To mark the state |01⟩, we would need to:\n",
    "   - Apply an X gate to qubit 0 (to flip it from |0⟩ to |1⟩)\n",
    "   - Apply the CZ gate\n",
    "   - Apply another X gate to qubit 0 to restore it\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This sequence temporarily transforms |01⟩ to |11⟩, applies the phase flip to |11⟩, and then transforms it back to |01⟩, effectively marking only the |01⟩ state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Without an oracle, the diffusion operator would amplify the average amplitude across all states, which would not lead to any state being preferentially measured. The result would be a uniform distribution across all possible states, similar to the initial superposition. The oracle is essential because it creates the asymmetry that the diffusion operator can then amplify."

    "## Reflection Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The probability oscillates as you increase iterations beyond the optimal value. This is because Grover's algorithm rotates the quantum state in a two-dimensional subspace. The optimal number of iterations rotates the state close to the target state, but continuing to rotate will eventually move it away from the target. This is why finding the correct number of iterations is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. With 100 qubits, you could theoretically search a space of 2^100 ≈ 10^30 items. The optimal number of iterations would be approximately π/4 * √(2^100) ≈ π/4 * 2^50 ≈ 10^15 iterations. While this is a massive speedup over the classical 2^100 operations, it's still an enormous number of operations that would take a very long time even on a perfect quantum computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Real-world applications include:\n",
    "   - Breaking symmetric cryptography (e.g., brute-forcing encryption keys)\n",
    "   - Database search when no indexing is available\n",
    "   - Constraint satisfaction problems \n",
    "   - Optimization problems that can be formulated as search problems\n",
    "   - Solving systems of linear equations\n",
    "   - Finding collisions in hash functions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Limitations of Grover's algorithm:\n",
    "   - Requires a quantum oracle that can recognize the solution\n",
    "   - Provides only quadratic speedup, which may not be enough for many problems\n",
    "   - Requires knowing the exact number of solutions for optimal performance\n",
    "   - Highly structured problems often have classical algorithms that outperform Grover's\n",
