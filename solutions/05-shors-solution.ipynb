    "# Applied Quantum Computing Lab: Shor's Algorithm (SOLUTIONS)\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will guide you through implementing and understanding Shor's algorithm, one of the most significant quantum algorithms with revolutionary implications for cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Understanding of quantum gates and quantum circuits\n",
    "- Familiarity with Python and Qiskit\n",
    "- Basic knowledge of modular arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "By completing this lab, you will:\n",
    "1. Understand the foundational principles of Shor's algorithm\n",
    "2. Implement key components of the quantum period-finding subroutine\n",
    "3. Apply Shor's algorithm to factorize small numbers\n",
    "4. Explore the implications of Shor's algorithm for cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Shor's algorithm, developed by Peter Shor in 1994, provides an efficient quantum method for finding the prime factors of an integer. This algorithm is particularly significant because it can break RSA encryption, one of the most widely used public-key cryptography systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem Statement**: Given a non-prime integer N, find its prime factors.\n",
    "   - Classical approach: Best known algorithms are sub-exponential in the number of digits (e.g., General Number Field Sieve)\n",
    "   - Shor's approach: Polynomial time in the number of digits\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Quantum Advantage**: Shor's algorithm achieves this extraordinary speedup by using quantum superposition to find the period of a function, which is then used to determine the factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Algorithm Structure**:\n",
    "   - Classical part: Reframing the factoring problem as finding the period of a function\n",
    "   - Quantum part: Using quantum Fourier transform to efficiently find this period\n",
    "   - Classical part: Using the period to compute the factors\n",
    "\n",

    "## Reflection Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why is Shor's algorithm a threat to RSA encryption?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Shor's algorithm can efficiently factor large numbers, which directly attacks the mathematical foundation of RSA encryption. RSA's security relies on the computational difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. A classical computer would take billions of years to factor large RSA keys (2048 or 4096 bits), but a sufficiently powerful quantum computer using Shor's algorithm could potentially do it in hours or days. This would render most of our current public-key cryptography systems vulnerable, compromising secure communications across the internet, including e-commerce, banking, and confidential communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why is finding periods exponentially faster on quantum computers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The exponential speedup comes from the quantum Fourier transform's ability to efficiently extract periodicities from functions. When we create a superposition of all possible inputs and apply the function, the quantum state encodes information about the entire function at once. The quantum Fourier transform can then extract the period in a single operation, essentially performing an exponential number of classical calculations simultaneously through quantum parallelism. Classically, we would need to evaluate the function for many different values and analyze the pattern, requiring O(N) operations, whereas the quantum approach requires only O((log N)²) operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main challenges in implementing Shor's algorithm on current hardware:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Qubit Count**: Factoring even modest numbers requires many high-quality qubits. For example, factoring a 1024-bit number might require thousands of logical qubits.\n",
    "   - **Decoherence**: Quantum states are fragile and lose their quantum properties through interaction with the environment. The complex circuits needed for Shor's algorithm would need to maintain quantum coherence throughout the computation.\n",
    "   - **Quantum Error Correction**: Current quantum computers have high error rates, requiring error correction that multiplies the physical qubit requirements by 10-1000×.\n",
    "   - **Circuit Depth**: The modular exponentiation step requires deep circuits with many gates, increasing the probability of errors.\n",
    "   - **Control Precision**: Implementing precise quantum gates with high fidelity is technically challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Qubits needed for 2048-bit RSA:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Factoring a 2048-bit number using Shor's algorithm would require approximately 2n to 3n qubits for the main register (where n=2048) plus additional qubits for calculation, totaling roughly 4000-8000 logical qubits. When quantum error correction is factored in, this could translate to millions of physical qubits with current error rates. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   This is infeasible because:\n",
    "   - The largest quantum computers today have only around 100-200 qubits\n",
    "   - These qubits lack sufficient coherence time and gate fidelity for such complex algorithms\n",
    "   - Current error rates would require prohibitively large numbers of physical qubits\n",
    "   - The complex quantum circuits required for modular exponentiation of large numbers have not been successfully implemented at scale"
