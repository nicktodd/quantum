    "# Applied Quantum Computing Lab: Shor's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will guide you through implementing and understanding Shor's algorithm, one of the most significant quantum algorithms with revolutionary implications for cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Understanding of quantum gates and quantum circuits\n",
    "- Familiarity with Python and Qiskit\n",
    "- Basic knowledge of modular arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "By completing this lab, you will:\n",
    "1. Understand the foundational principles of Shor's algorithm\n",
    "2. Implement key components of the quantum period-finding subroutine\n",
    "3. Apply Shor's algorithm to factorize small numbers\n",
    "4. Explore the implications of Shor's algorithm for cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Shor's algorithm, developed by Peter Shor in 1994, provides an efficient quantum method for finding the prime factors of an integer. This algorithm is particularly significant because it can break RSA encryption, one of the most widely used public-key cryptography systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem Statement**: Given a non-prime integer N, find its prime factors.\n",
    "   - Classical approach: Best known algorithms are sub-exponential in the number of digits (e.g., General Number Field Sieve)\n",
    "   - Shor's approach: Polynomial time in the number of digits\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Quantum Advantage**: Shor's algorithm achieves this extraordinary speedup by using quantum superposition to find the period of a function, which is then used to determine the factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Algorithm Structure**:\n",
    "   - Classical part: Reframing the factoring problem as finding the period of a function\n",
    "   - Quantum part: Using quantum Fourier transform to efficiently find this period\n",
    "   - Classical part: Using the period to compute the factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement Shor's algorithm step by step."
