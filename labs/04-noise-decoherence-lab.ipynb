    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you have explored:\n",
    "- Different types of quantum noise models (bit-flip, phase-flip, depolarizing)\n",
    "- The effects of noise on single-qubit and multi-qubit circuits\n",
    "- Visualization of noise effects on the Bloch sphere\n",
    "- Basic error mitigation techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding quantum noise and decoherence is crucial for the development of practical quantum computers. As quantum systems scale up, error correction and mitigation strategies become increasingly important for running reliable quantum algorithms."
