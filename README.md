# Quantum Course Labs and Demos

Many of the demonstrations require the qiskit simulator library to be installed.

```
pip install qiskit
pip install qiskit-aer
pip install pylatexenc

```

To launch a local Jupyter, at an Anaconda prompt type:

```
jupyter notebook --notebook-dir="D:\GitRepos\Courses\quantum"
```

The path may vary depending upon your system.

If you want to try a real quantum computer on AWS, then you will also need this dependency.

```
pip install amazon-braket-sdk
```
