# Quantum Course Labs and Demos

Many of the demonstrations require the qiskit simulator library to be installed.

```
pip install qiskit
pip install qiskit-aer
```

To launch a local Jupyter, at an Anaconda prompt type:

```
jupyter notebook --notebook-dir="D:\GitRepos\Courses\quantum"
```

The path may vary depending upon your system.
